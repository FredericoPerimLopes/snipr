# PRD: Semantic Code Retrieval

## Executive Summary

The Semantic Code Retrieval engine addresses the critical challenge of code discovery and context management in large codebases. By providing intelligent semantic indexing with natural language query capabilities, it bridges the gap between developer intent and code location, while optimizing LLM context for AI coding tools. The system will support major programming languages and offer both MCP server integration and embeddable SDK options.

## Problem Statement

### Core Problems
- **Context Window Noise**: AI coding tools struggle with large codebases due to context window limitations and irrelevant code inclusion
- **Poor Code Discovery**: Traditional keyword-based search fails to understand code semantics and relationships
- **Scale Inefficiency**: Large codebases (1M+ LOC) make manual code navigation and understanding prohibitively slow
- **Relationship Blindness**: Existing tools don't capture complex code relationships, dependencies, and architectural patterns

### Why Now?
- AI coding tools are becoming mainstream but hit limitations with large codebases
- Developer productivity is bottlenecked by code discovery rather than code writing
- Modern codebases are increasingly complex with microservices and distributed architectures
- LLM context optimization is critical for effective AI-assisted development

## User Stories

### Primary Personas

**Senior Developer (Alex)**
- Needs to understand unfamiliar codebase sections quickly
- Wants to find existing implementations before writing new code
- Requires context-aware refactoring assistance

**AI Tool User (Morgan)**
- Frustrated by AI tools providing irrelevant suggestions due to poor context
- Needs precise code context for LLM prompts
- Wants natural language queries for code discovery

**Tech Lead (Sam)**
- Responsible for architectural decisions and code review
- Needs to understand cross-cutting concerns and dependencies
- Requires insights into code patterns and anti-patterns

### Detailed User Journeys

**Journey 1: Feature Implementation Discovery**
1. Alex receives task: "Add rate limiting to payment service"
2. Queries: "Show me existing rate limiting implementations"
3. System returns relevant rate limiting code across codebase
4. Alex examines patterns, selects best approach
5. Queries: "Find all payment service entry points"
6. System provides context-optimized code for LLM assistance

**Journey 2: Refactoring Assistance**
1. Morgan wants to modernize legacy JavaScript
2. Queries: "Find all regular functions that could be arrow functions"
3. System identifies candidates with semantic analysis
4. Morgan uses results to guide systematic refactoring
5. System provides before/after context for LLM validation

**Journey 3: Architecture Understanding**
1. Sam needs to understand service dependencies
2. Queries: "Show me all authentication-related code"
3. System maps authentication flow across multiple services
4. Sam identifies security gaps and improvement opportunities

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Core Indexing Capabilities
- **Multi-language Support**: Python, TypeScript, Rust, Go, C#, Java, C/C++
- **Real-time Indexing**: Watch filesystem changes and update index incrementally
- **Semantic Analysis**: Extract and understand code relationships, not just text matching
- **Language Element Extraction**:
  - Functions/methods with signatures and documentation
  - Classes, interfaces, structs, and type definitions
  - Module/package boundaries and exports
  - Import/dependency relationships
  - Variable declarations and usage patterns

#### Query Interface
- **Natural Language Processing**: Accept and interpret developer queries in plain English
- **Query Types Supported**:
  - Semantic search: "Find authentication functions"
  - Pattern matching: "Show error handling patterns"
  - Similarity search: "Find functions similar to this one"
  - Dependency tracking: "What calls this deprecated method?"
  - Refactoring queries: "Find functions to convert to arrow functions"
- **Context Ranking**: Prioritize results by relevance and semantic similarity

#### Integration Capabilities
- **MCP Server**: Standalone server exposing semantic search via Model Context Protocol
- **Embeddable SDK**: Library for direct integration into applications
- **API Interface**: RESTful API for external tool integration
- **Context Optimization**: Intelligent selection and ranking for LLM context windows

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance
- **Indexing Speed**: Initial index of 1M LOC codebase within 10 minutes
- **Query Response**: Sub-second response for semantic queries
- **Memory Efficiency**: Reasonable RAM usage for large codebases (target: <4GB for 1M LOC)
- **Incremental Updates**: Real-time file change processing within 1 second

#### Scalability
- **Codebase Size**: Support up to 10M+ lines of code
- **Concurrent Users**: Handle 100+ concurrent queries
- **File Watch**: Monitor thousands of files simultaneously
- **Language Extensibility**: Plugin architecture for additional language support

#### Reliability
- **Index Integrity**: Automatic recovery from corrupted indices
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when language parsers fail
- **Data Consistency**: Ensure index reflects actual codebase state
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime for MCP server deployment

#### Security
- **Access Control**: Respect filesystem permissions
- **Data Privacy**: No code content transmitted externally
- **Secure Communication**: Encrypted MCP protocol communication
- **Audit Logging**: Track query patterns for security monitoring

## Success Criteria
