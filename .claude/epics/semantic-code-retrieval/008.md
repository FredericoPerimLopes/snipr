# Task 008: Multi-language AST Processing Pipeline

## Overview
Build a unified AST processing pipeline that normalizes semantic elements across different programming languages into a consistent format for indexing and search. This pipeline will enable cross-language semantic understanding and unified query capabilities.

## Problem Statement
Different programming languages have varying syntax and semantic structures, but conceptually similar elements (functions, classes, modules) need to be indexed uniformly for:
- Cross-language semantic search
- Consistent embedding generation
- Unified query interfaces
- Language-agnostic relationship analysis
- Standardized metadata extraction

## Technical Requirements

### Unified Semantic Model
- **Common Element Types**: Functions, classes, variables, modules, interfaces
- **Relationship Mapping**: Dependencies, inheritance, composition, usage patterns
- **Metadata Normalization**: Standardized attributes across languages
- **Type System Abstraction**: Unified type representation for typed/untyped languages
- **Documentation Integration**: Consistent docstring/comment processing

### Processing Pipeline Components
- **AST Normalization**: Convert language-specific ASTs to unified format
- **Semantic Element Extraction**: Extract common semantic patterns across languages
- **Relationship Analysis**: Build cross-language dependency graphs
- **Metadata Enrichment**: Add computed attributes and derived information
- **Validation and Quality Assurance**: Ensure semantic consistency

### Cross-Language Analysis
- **Function Similarity**: Identify similar functions across languages
- **Interface Compatibility**: Match interfaces and contracts across language boundaries
- **Pattern Recognition**: Detect common design patterns regardless of language
- **Dependency Tracking**: Cross-language dependency analysis for polyglot projects

## Implementation Details

### Unified Semantic Schema
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct SemanticElement {
    pub id: ElementId,
    pub kind: ElementKind,
    pub name: String,
    pub location: SourceLocation,
    pub language: Language,
    pub attributes: ElementAttributes,
    pub relationships: Vec<Relationship>,
    pub metadata: HashMap<String, Value>,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub enum ElementKind {
    Function { signature: FunctionSignature, returns: Option<TypeInfo> },
    Class { inheritance: Vec<TypeRef>, methods: Vec<ElementId> },
    Interface { methods: Vec<MethodSignature> },
    Variable { type_info: Option<TypeInfo>, scope: Scope },
    Module { exports: Vec<ElementId>, imports: Vec<ImportRef> },
    Type { definition: TypeDefinition },
}
```

### Processing Pipeline Architecture
```rust
pub struct ProcessingPipeline {
    normalizers: HashMap<Language, Box<dyn ASTNormalizer>>,
    extractors: Vec<Box<dyn SemanticExtractor>>,
    analyzers: Vec<Box<dyn RelationshipAnalyzer>>,
    validators: Vec<Box<dyn SemanticValidator>>,
}

pub trait ASTNormalizer {
    fn normalize(&self, ast: &Tree, source: &str) -> Result<NormalizedAST, ProcessingError>;
}

pub trait SemanticExtractor {
    fn extract(&self, normalized_ast: &NormalizedAST) -> Vec<SemanticElement>;
}
```

### Language Abstraction Layer
- **Type System Mapping**: Map language-specific types to unified type system
- **Scope Resolution**: Standardize scope and visibility concepts
- **Naming Conventions**: Normalize naming patterns across languages
- **Documentation Formats**: Unify comment and docstring processing

pub struct UnifiedFunction {
    pub name: String,
    pub parameters: Vec<Parameter>,
    pub return_type: Option<UnifiedType>,
    pub visibility: Visibility,
    pub is_async: bool,
    pub decorators: Vec<Decorator>,

impl From<TypeScriptFunction> for UnifiedFunction { /* ... */ }
```
