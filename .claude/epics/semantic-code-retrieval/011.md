# Semantic Similarity Search Engine

## Objective
Implement a sophisticated semantic search engine that combines vector similarity, code relationships, and contextual relevance to deliver highly accurate code retrieval results.

## Context
This task builds the core search engine that leverages vector embeddings and relationship graphs to find semantically similar code. It transforms natural language queries into precise code location results.

## Technical Requirements

### Search Algorithm Core
- Implement vector similarity search using cosine similarity
- Integrate relationship graph traversal for context expansion
- Develop hybrid ranking that combines multiple signals
- Support multi-modal search (code + documentation + comments)

### Relevance Scoring System
- Vector similarity scores (0.0-1.0 range)
- Relationship proximity weighting
- Code quality and recency factors
- User interaction and feedback integration

### Query Processing Pipeline
- Query preprocessing and normalization
- Intent classification (find function, understand pattern, etc.)
- Multi-stage retrieval with filtering
- Result post-processing and ranking

### Advanced Search Features
- Faceted search by language, file type, project area
- Temporal search (recent changes, version history)
- Contextual search (within specific modules/packages)
- Fuzzy matching for partial or imprecise queries

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Search Functionality
- [ ] Vector similarity search returns relevant results
- [ ] Hybrid ranking improves result quality over pure vector search
- [ ] Search handles queries of varying specificity and clarity
- [ ] Multi-language search works seamlessly across codebases
- [ ] Result relevance improves with user feedback

### Performance Standards
- [ ] Search queries return results in < 200ms
- [ ] Can handle concurrent searches without degradation
- [ ] Supports real-time search suggestions/autocomplete
- [ ] Scales to codebases with 100K+ code elements
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable during high query volume

### Search Quality Metrics
- [ ] Top-5 results contain relevant code 85%+ of the time
- [ ] Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) > 0.7 for test queries
- [ ] User satisfaction rating > 4.0/5.0 in testing
- [ ] False positive rate < 10% for specific queries
- [ ] Handles edge cases gracefully (empty results, errors)

## Implementation Notes

### Search Architecture
```python
# Example search engine structure
class SemanticSearchEngine:
    def __init__(self, vector_db: VectorDB, relationship_graph: RelationshipGraph):
        self.vector_db = vector_db
        self.graph = relationship_graph
        self.ranker = HybridRanker()
    
    def search(self, query: str, context: SearchContext = None) -> SearchResults:
        # Multi-stage search pipeline
        candidates = self.vector_search(query)
        expanded = self.expand_with_relationships(candidates)
        ranked = self.ranker.rank(expanded, query, context)
        return self.format_results(ranked)
    
    def vector_search(self, query: str) -> List[CodeElement]:
        # Vector similarity search
        pass
    
    def expand_with_relationships(self, candidates: List[CodeElement]) -> List[CodeElement]:
        # Use relationship graph to expand results
        pass
```

### Ranking Algorithm
```python
# Hybrid ranking approach
class HybridRanker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.weights = {
            'vector_similarity': 0.4,
            'relationship_proximity': 0.2,
            'code_quality': 0.15,
            'recency': 0.1,
            'user_feedback': 0.15
        }
    
    def rank(self, candidates: List[CodeElement], query: str, 
             context: SearchContext) -> List[RankedResult]:
        # Multi-factor ranking implementation
        pass
```

### Search Optimization
