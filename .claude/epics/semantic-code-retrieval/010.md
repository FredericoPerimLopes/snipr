# Code Relationship Analysis and Dependency Mapping

## Objective
Implement comprehensive code relationship analysis to extract dependencies, call graphs, and semantic connections between code elements for enhanced retrieval context.

## Context
This task builds sophisticated understanding of code relationships that goes beyond simple text matching. It creates a rich graph of code dependencies and semantic connections that enables context-aware retrieval.

## Technical Requirements

### Dependency Analysis
- Extract import/include relationships across files
- Build module and package dependency graphs
- Identify circular dependencies and suggest resolutions
- Track version dependencies and compatibility

### Call Graph Construction
- Generate function/method call relationships
- Identify inheritance hierarchies and interfaces
- Map data flow between components
- Track variable and parameter usage patterns

### Cross-Reference Mapping
- Link function definitions to all call sites
- Connect variable declarations to usage locations
- Map type definitions to instantiation points
- Identify refactoring impact zones

### Semantic Relationship Detection
- Identify conceptually related functions (similar purpose)
- Group related data structures and types
- Detect design patterns and architectural components
- Find code duplication and similar implementations

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Complete dependency graph for all supported languages
- [ ] Call graph generation with accurate relationships
- [ ] Cross-reference mapping covers 95%+ of code elements
- [ ] Semantic grouping identifies related code clusters
- [ ] Graph data structure supports efficient queries

### Relationship Types
- [ ] Import/dependency relationships tracked
- [ ] Function call relationships mapped
- [ ] Type usage and inheritance captured
- [ ] Variable flow and data dependencies identified
- [ ] Conceptual similarity relationships established

### Performance Standards
- [ ] Graph construction completes in < 2 minutes for 10K functions
- [ ] Relationship queries return results in < 100ms
- [ ] Memory usage scales linearly with codebase size
- [ ] Incremental updates process changes in < 10 seconds
- [ ] Graph persistence and loading under 30 seconds

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Architecture
```python
# Example relationship graph structure
class CodeRelationshipGraph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.nodes = {}  # code elements
        self.edges = {}  # relationships
        
    def add_dependency(self, source: CodeElement, target: CodeElement, 
                      relationship_type: RelationType):
        # Add relationship to graph
        pass
    
    def find_related(self, element: CodeElement, 
                    relationship_types: List[RelationType],
                    max_depth: int = 3) -> List[CodeElement]:
        # Traverse graph to find related elements
        pass
    
    def get_impact_analysis(self, element: CodeElement) -> ImpactReport:
        # Analyze potential refactoring impact
        pass
```

### Relationship Categories
- **Structural**: imports, inheritance, composition
- **Behavioral**: function calls, event handling, data flow
- **Conceptual**: similar functionality, related domains
- **Temporal**: code evolution, change patterns

### Graph Optimization
- Use adjacency lists for memory efficiency
- Implement graph caching for frequent queries
- Support incremental graph updates
- Plan for distributed graph storage

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Relationship extraction accuracy per language
- Graph construction and query performance
- Edge case handling (circular dependencies, etc.)
- Memory usage validation

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end relationship mapping on real codebases
- Cross-language dependency tracking
- Graph persistence and recovery
- Performance with large-scale projects

### Validation Tests
- Manual verification of relationship accuracy
- Comparison with static analysis tools
- False positive/negative rate analysis
- User experience testing for relationship exploration

## Success Metrics
- Relationship accuracy: > 95% precision
- Graph construction: < 2 minutes for 10K functions
- Query performance: < 100ms response time
- Memory efficiency: < 10MB per 1K functions
- Update latency: < 10 seconds for incremental changes

## Future Enhancements
- Machine learning for relationship confidence scoring
- Integration with code quality metrics
- Support for dynamic language analysis
- Real-time collaboration graph updates
