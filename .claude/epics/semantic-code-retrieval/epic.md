# Epic: Semantic Code Retrieval

## Overview
Build an intelligent semantic code indexing and retrieval engine that understands code relationships and enables natural language queries. The system will feature real-time AST-based indexing, vector embeddings for semantic search, and optimized context delivery for LLM tools via MCP server integration.

## Architecture Decisions
- **Local-First Architecture**: All processing runs locally for security and privacy
- **Tree-sitter Based Parsing**: Leverage tree-sitter for robust, incremental AST parsing across languages
- **Vector Database Integration**: Use Chroma or similar for embedding storage and similarity search
- **MCP-First Integration**: Prioritize MCP server implementation for immediate Claude Code compatibility
- **Incremental Design**: Real-time file watching with efficient delta updates
- **Modular Language Support**: Plugin architecture allowing gradual language addition

## Technical Approach

### Core Engine Components
- **Indexing Engine**: Multi-threaded file processor with tree-sitter parsers
- **Semantic Analyzer**: Code relationship extractor and dependency mapper
- **Vector Store**: Embedding generation and similarity search system
- **Query Processor**: Natural language to semantic query translation
- **Context Optimizer**: LLM-aware result ranking and formatting

### Backend Services
- **File System Monitor**: Real-time change detection and queue management
- **Language Plugin System**: Extensible parser registration and configuration
- **Index Management**: Storage, versioning, and corruption recovery
- **MCP Server Implementation**: Protocol-compliant server with tool exposure
- **Caching Layer**: Query result caching and performance optimization

### Infrastructure
- **Local Storage**: Efficient index storage with SQLite + vector database
- **Memory Management**: Streaming processing for large codebases
- **Configuration System**: User preferences and language-specific settings
- **Logging and Diagnostics**: Comprehensive observability for troubleshooting

## Implementation Strategy
- **Phase 1**: Core indexing with Python/TypeScript support and basic semantic search
- **Phase 2**: MCP server integration with advanced query processing
- **Phase 3**: Additional language support and performance optimization
- **Risk Mitigation**: Start with proven technologies (tree-sitter, established embedding models)
- **Testing Approach**: Multi-language test codebases with automated accuracy validation

## Task Breakdown Preview
High-level task categories that will be created:
- [ ] Core Infrastructure: Indexing engine, file monitoring, and storage systems
- [ ] Language Support: Tree-sitter integration and multi-language parsing
- [ ] Semantic Processing: Vector embeddings and relationship analysis
- [ ] Query Engine: Natural language processing and semantic search
- [ ] MCP Integration: Server implementation and protocol compliance
- [ ] Context Optimization: LLM-aware result formatting and ranking
- [ ] Performance Optimization: Caching, memory management, and scalability
- [ ] Testing & Validation: Multi-language test suites and accuracy metrics

## Dependencies
- **External Libraries**: tree-sitter parsers, vector database (Chroma), embedding models
- **Development Tools**: Rust toolchain, Python environment, testing frameworks
- **MCP Ecosystem**: Model Context Protocol specification and client implementations
- **Language Ecosystems**: Access to representative codebases for testing each language

## Success Criteria (Technical)
- **Indexing Performance**: 1M LOC indexed in <10 minutes with <4GB RAM usage
- **Query Accuracy**: >90% relevant results in top 10 for semantic queries
- **Response Time**: <500ms average query response time
- **Real-time Updates**: File changes reflected in index within 1 second
- **MCP Compliance**: Full protocol compatibility with Claude Code and other MCP clients

## Estimated Effort
- **Overall Timeline**: 6 months for full implementation
- **Core Team**: 2-3 senior engineers with Rust/Python expertise
- **Critical Path**: Semantic analysis and vector embedding integration
- **MVP Milestone**: 3 months for Python/TypeScript support with MCP server
