## Description
Develop a comprehensive test suite and validation framework to ensure the semantic code retrieval system works accurately across all supported programming languages with measurable quality metrics.

## Goals
- Create extensive test cases for all supported languages
- Implement automated accuracy validation
- Establish quality benchmarks and regression testing
- Provide continuous integration testing pipeline
- Enable language-specific testing scenarios

## Acceptance Criteria

### Multi-Language Test Coverage
- [ ] Python test suite with 500+ test cases covering frameworks (Django, Flask, FastAPI)
- [ ] JavaScript/TypeScript tests for React, Node.js, and Vanilla JS patterns
- [ ] Java test cases for Spring Boot, Maven, and enterprise patterns
- [ ] C++ tests covering STL, Boost, and modern C++ features
- [ ] Go test cases for standard library and popular frameworks
- [ ] Rust tests for common crates and async patterns
- [ ] C# tests for .NET Core and framework-specific patterns

### Test Case Categories
- [ ] Function/method retrieval accuracy tests
- [ ] Class and interface discovery tests
- [ ] Variable and constant identification tests
- [ ] Import/dependency tracking tests
- [ ] Cross-file reference resolution tests
- [ ] Edge case handling (empty files, malformed code)
- [ ] Large file performance tests (>10MB source files)

### Accuracy Metrics Framework
- [ ] Implement precision, recall, and F1-score calculations
- [ ] Add semantic similarity scoring for retrieved results
- [ ] Create relevance ranking validation
- [ ] Implement false positive/negative tracking
- [ ] Add query intent classification accuracy
- [ ] Support A/B testing for algorithm improvements

### Validation Pipeline
- [ ] Automated test execution on code changes
- [ ] Golden dataset maintenance for benchmark comparisons
- [ ] Regression detection and alerting system
- [ ] Performance benchmark tracking over time
- [ ] Test result visualization and reporting

### Language-Specific Validation
- [ ] Python: Framework-specific patterns, decorators, metaclasses
- [ ] JavaScript: Closures, prototypes, async/await patterns
- [ ] Java: Annotations, generics, lambda expressions
- [ ] C++: Templates, RAII, modern features (C++17/20)
- [ ] Go: Interfaces, goroutines, channels
- [ ] Rust: Ownership, lifetimes, trait implementations
- [ ] C#: LINQ, async/await, extension methods

### Accuracy Measurement System
- **Precision**: (Relevant Retrieved) / (Total Retrieved)
- **Recall**: (Relevant Retrieved) / (Total Relevant)
- **F1-Score**: 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
- **Semantic Similarity**: Cosine similarity between expected and actual results
- **Ranking Quality**: nDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain)

### Golden Dataset Structure
- Curated code samples from popular open-source projects
- Hand-annotated ground truth for semantic queries
- Edge cases and corner case scenarios
- Performance benchmark code repositories
- Multi-language polyglot projects

### CI/CD Integration
- Automated test execution on every commit
- Performance regression detection
- Accuracy threshold enforcement
- Test coverage reporting
- Failed test case analysis and debugging

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Complete test suite for all 7 supported languages
- [ ] Accuracy metrics framework operational
- [ ] Golden dataset established and validated
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline integrated and running
- [ ] Performance benchmarks baseline established
- [ ] Regression testing automated
- [ ] Test coverage > 90% for core components
- [ ] Language-specific edge cases covered
- [ ] Test result reporting and visualization working
- [ ] Documentation for adding new test cases completed

## Notes
- Use property-based testing for generating diverse test scenarios
- Implement test case generation from real-world code repositories
- Consider using mutation testing to validate test suite quality
- Set up test data versioning for reproducible results
- Monitor test execution time to prevent CI/CD bottlenecks
