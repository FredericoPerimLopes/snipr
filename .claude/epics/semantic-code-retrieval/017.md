```

### Performance Targets
- Query Response Time: < 100ms (95th percentile)
- Cache Hit Rate: > 80% for repeated queries
- Memory Usage: < 2GB per instance
- Concurrent Users: Support 100+ simultaneous queries
- Throughput: > 1000 queries per second

### Implementation Components
- **CacheManager**: Multi-level cache orchestration
- **MemoryOptimizer**: Memory usage monitoring and optimization
- **ProfilerIntegration**: Performance profiling and analysis
- **MetricsCollector**: Performance metrics and monitoring
- **LoadBalancer**: Query distribution and scaling

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All caching layers implemented and tested
- [ ] Performance targets met under load testing
- [ ] Memory optimization strategies deployed
- [ ] Profiling tools integrated and functional
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards operational
- [ ] Performance regression test suite created
- [ ] Cache invalidation working correctly

## Notes
- Consider using Apache Arrow for efficient in-memory data structures
- Evaluate different caching strategies (write-through, write-back, write-around)
- Monitor for cache stampede scenarios in high-concurrency situations
- Implement graceful degradation when cache is unavailable
- Consider edge caching for geographically distributed deployments
