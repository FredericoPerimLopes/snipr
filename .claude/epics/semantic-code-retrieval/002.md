## Summary
Design and implement the core indexing engine that parses code files, extracts semantic information, and prepares data for storage and retrieval.

## Objectives
- Build multi-threaded code parsing system using tree-sitter
- Extract semantic elements (functions, classes, variables, imports)
- Generate embeddings for semantic similarity search
- Implement efficient batch processing for large codebases
- Create extensible architecture for multiple programming languages

## Technical Requirements

### Parsing Architecture
```rust
pub struct IndexingEngine {
    parser_pool: Arc<Mutex<Vec<TreeSitterParser>>>,
    language_configs: HashMap<String, LanguageConfig>,
    embedding_generator: Arc<dyn EmbeddingGenerator>,
    thread_pool: ThreadPool,
}

pub trait CodeElement {
    fn element_type(&self) -> ElementType;
    fn name(&self) -> &str;
    fn signature(&self) -> Option<&str>;
    fn location(&self) -> FileLocation;
    fn content(&self) -> &str;
    fn generate_embedding(&self) -> Result<Vec<f32>>;
}
```

### Language Support
- **Phase 1**: Rust, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Phase 2**: Go, Java, C/C++
- **Extensible**: Plugin architecture for additional languages

### Semantic Extraction
- Function/method definitions with signatures
- Class/struct/interface declarations
- Variable declarations and types
- Import/use statements and dependencies
- Comments and documentation
- Control flow patterns

### Performance Requirements
- Process 10,000+ files efficiently
- Multi-threaded parsing with configurable concurrency
- Incremental indexing for changed files only
- Memory-efficient streaming for large files
- Batched operations for database writes

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Tree-sitter parsers integrated for target languages
- [ ] Semantic element extraction working for all supported languages
- [ ] Multi-threaded processing with configurable worker count
- [ ] Embedding generation integrated (local model or API)
- [ ] Error handling for malformed/unparseable files
- [ ] Progress tracking and cancellation support
- [ ] Memory usage stays under 500MB for 50k file codebase
- [ ] Processing speed: 100+ files per second on modern hardware

## Implementation Notes
- Use tree-sitter-highlight for syntax highlighting integration
- Implement language-specific extraction strategies
- Cache parsed trees for unchanged files
- Use structured concurrency for safe multi-threading
- Implement backpressure to prevent memory overflow

## Definition of Done
- Core indexing engine processes major languages correctly
- Performance benchmarks meet or exceed targets
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Unit tests cover all extraction logic
- Integration tests verify end-to-end functionality
