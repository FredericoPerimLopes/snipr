## Summary
Establish the foundational Rust project structure, development environment, and CI/CD pipeline for the semantic code retrieval system.

## Objectives
- Set up Rust workspace with proper project structure
- Configure development dependencies and tooling
- Establish CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
- Define coding standards and linting rules
- Create basic project documentation structure

## Technical Requirements

### Project Structure
```
semantic-code-retrieval/
├── Cargo.toml (workspace)
├── crates/
│   ├── core/           # Core indexing engine
│   ├── storage/        # Database and storage layer
│   ├── monitor/        # File system monitoring
│   ├── api/            # REST API server
│   └── cli/            # Command-line interface
├── tests/              # Integration tests
├── benchmarks/         # Performance benchmarks
└── docs/               # Technical documentation
```

### Dependencies
- **Core**: tokio (async runtime), serde (serialization), anyhow (error handling)
- **Storage**: sqlx (SQLite integration), rusqlite (embedded SQLite)
- **Monitoring**: notify (file system events), walkdir (directory traversal)
- **Parsing**: tree-sitter (syntax parsing), tree-sitter-rust, tree-sitter-python, etc.
- **Vector Operations**: candle-core (ML embeddings), hnsw (vector similarity)
- **API**: axum (web framework), tower (middleware)
- **CLI**: clap (command parsing), indicatif (progress bars)

### Development Tools
- rustfmt (code formatting)
- clippy (linting)
- cargo-watch (development server)
- cargo-nextest (faster testing)
- cargo-audit (security auditing)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Rust workspace compiles successfully with all crates
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline runs tests, linting, and security checks
- [ ] Development environment documented in README
- [ ] Coding standards enforced via clippy and rustfmt
- [ ] Basic logging infrastructure configured
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility verified (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- [ ] Performance profiling tools integrated

## Implementation Notes
- Use Rust 2021 edition with latest stable compiler
- Configure workspace-level Cargo.toml for dependency management
- Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
- Include benchmarking framework for performance regression testing
- Configure structured logging with tracing crate

## Definition of Done
- All crates compile without warnings
- CI pipeline passes all checks
- Development setup guide allows new contributors to start immediately
- Baseline performance benchmarks established
