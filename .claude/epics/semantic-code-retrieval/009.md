# Vector Database Integration and Embeddings

## Objective
Implement vector database integration with Chroma for storing and retrieving code embeddings, enabling semantic similarity search across the codebase.

## Context
This task establishes the foundation for semantic code retrieval by setting up vector storage and embedding generation. It builds on the language support tasks to create vector representations of parsed code elements.

## Technical Requirements

### Vector Database Setup
- Integrate ChromaDB as the primary vector database
- Configure persistent storage for embeddings
- Implement collection management for different code types
- Set up indexing strategies for optimal query performance

### Embedding Generation
- Implement code-to-vector transformation pipeline
- Support multiple embedding models (CodeBERT, UniXcoder, etc.)
- Create embeddings for:
  - Function/method signatures and bodies
  - Class definitions and structures
  - Documentation and comments
  - File-level abstracts

### Storage Optimization
- Implement efficient batch processing for large codebases
- Add compression strategies for storage efficiency
- Create incremental update mechanisms
- Support for embedding versioning and migration

### Performance Features
- Lazy loading for large vector collections
- Memory-efficient batch operations
- Connection pooling and resource management
- Query caching mechanisms

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Functionality
- [ ] ChromaDB successfully integrated and configured
- [ ] Embedding pipeline processes all supported languages
- [ ] Vector storage persists across application restarts
- [ ] Batch processing handles codebases with 10,000+ files
- [ ] Memory usage remains under 500MB for typical operations

### Quality Standards
- [ ] Embedding generation time < 100ms per function
- [ ] Vector similarity queries return results in < 50ms
- [ ] Storage efficiency: < 1KB per function embedding
- [ ] Support for at least 2 different embedding models
- [ ] Graceful handling of unsupported code constructs

### Integration Points
- [ ] Seamless integration with language parsers (tasks 005-008)
- [ ] API ready for semantic search implementation (task 011)
- [ ] Monitoring and metrics collection enabled
- [ ] Configuration management for different deployment scenarios

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Approach
```python
# Example embedding pipeline structure
class EmbeddingPipeline:
    def __init__(self, model_name: str, db_path: str):
        self.model = load_embedding_model(model_name)
        self.db = ChromaDB(db_path)
    
    def process_code_element(self, element: CodeElement) -> VectorEntry:
        # Generate embedding and store
        pass
    
    def batch_process(self, elements: List[CodeElement]) -> BatchResult:
        # Efficient batch processing
        pass
```

### Performance Considerations
- Use async operations for I/O bound tasks
- Implement connection pooling for database operations
- Consider GPU acceleration for embedding generation
- Plan for horizontal scaling of vector operations

### Error Handling
- Robust fallback for unsupported code patterns
- Graceful degradation when embedding models fail
- Transaction safety for batch operations
- Clear error reporting and recovery suggestions

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Embedding generation accuracy and consistency
- Vector storage and retrieval operations
- Batch processing performance and memory usage
- Error handling for edge cases

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end pipeline with real codebases
- Performance benchmarks with various code sizes
- Database persistence and recovery scenarios
- Multi-language support validation

### Performance Tests
- Load testing with large codebases
- Memory profiling during batch operations
- Query performance under concurrent access
- Storage efficiency measurements

## Success Metrics
- Embedding generation: < 100ms per function
- Vector queries: < 50ms response time
- Storage efficiency: < 1KB per embedding
- Memory usage: < 500MB during operations
- Batch throughput: > 100 functions/second
