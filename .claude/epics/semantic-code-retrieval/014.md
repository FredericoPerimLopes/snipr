## Description
Develop intelligent context optimization strategies that maximize the effectiveness of semantic code retrieval results when integrated with LLMs like Claude. This includes smart ranking, context window management, and result formatting optimized for code understanding.

## Problem Statement
Raw semantic search results need intelligent processing to be maximally useful for LLMs. We need to optimize context selection, ranking, and presentation to help LLMs better understand code relationships and provide more accurate assistance.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Context Window Management
- [ ] Dynamic context size adaptation based on LLM model
- [ ] Intelligent truncation preserving most relevant information
- [ ] Context priority scoring for optimal selection
- [ ] Support for different context window sizes (4K, 8K, 32K, 128K+)
- [ ] Hierarchical context inclusion strategies

### Smart Result Ranking
- [ ] Multi-factor relevance scoring algorithm
- [ ] User intent detection and adaptation
- [ ] Recency and importance weighting
- [ ] Cross-reference relationship scoring
- [ ] Personalization based on user patterns

### Context Formatting
- [ ] LLM-optimized code presentation
- [ ] Semantic relationship annotations
- [ ] Dependency graph summaries
- [ ] Code flow documentation
- [ ] Cross-file reference linking

### Adaptive Optimization
- [ ] Real-time performance monitoring
- [ ] A/B testing framework for ranking algorithms
- [ ] User feedback integration
- [ ] Context effectiveness metrics
- [ ] Continuous improvement pipeline

## Technical Specifications

### Context Optimizer
```typescript
interface ContextOptimizer {
  optimizeForLLM(
    results: SearchResult[],
    query: string,
    contextWindow: number,
    userIntent?: Intent
  ): OptimizedContext

  rankResults(
    results: SearchResult[],
    rankingFactors: RankingFactors
  ): RankedResult[]

  formatForLLM(
    context: OptimizedContext,
    format: LLMFormat
  ): FormattedContext
}
```

### Ranking Factors
- **Semantic similarity**: Vector space distance to query
- **Structural relevance**: Code relationship importance
- **Recency**: Last modification time weighting
- **Usage frequency**: How often code is accessed
- **Dependencies**: Critical path analysis
- **User context**: Historical interaction patterns

### Context Types
- **Primary context**: Direct matches and core implementations
- **Supporting context**: Related functions, types, and dependencies
- **Reference context**: Documentation, comments, and usage examples
- **Metadata context**: File structure, imports, and relationships

## Implementation Details

### Context Selection Algorithm
1. **Initial scoring**: Combine semantic similarity with structural relevance
2. **Intent detection**: Analyze query for specific user intents
3. **Dependency analysis**: Include critical dependencies and callers
4. **Context budgeting**: Allocate tokens across context types
5. **Final optimization**: Trim and format for target LLM

### LLM Format Optimization
- Code block organization with clear delimiters
- Inline comments explaining relationships
- Summary sections for complex dependencies
- Progressive disclosure for large codebases
- Structured metadata for quick scanning

### Performance Optimization
- Caching of ranking computations
- Incremental context updates
- Parallel processing of ranking factors
- Memory-efficient result streaming
- Adaptive algorithm selection

## Testing Strategy

### Effectiveness Testing

- Adjust ranking based on user interactions
- Personalize context selection over time
- Detect and adapt to different use cases
- Provide transparency in ranking decisions

### Quality Indicators
