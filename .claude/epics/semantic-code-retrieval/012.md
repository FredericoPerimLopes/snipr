# Natural Language Query Processing

## Objective
Implement natural language query processing that translates developer queries into semantic search operations, enabling intuitive code discovery through conversational interfaces.

## Context
This task creates the user-facing layer that allows developers to search code using natural language. It bridges the gap between human intent and machine-readable search operations.

## Technical Requirements

### Query Understanding
- Intent classification (find, understand, compare, modify)
- Entity extraction (function names, concepts, technologies)
- Query expansion and synonym handling
- Context preservation across multi-turn conversations

### Query Types Support
- **Find queries**: "Show me functions that handle file uploads"
- **Understand queries**: "How does authentication work in this system?"
- **Compare queries**: "What's the difference between these two implementations?"
- **Pattern queries**: "Find examples of the observer pattern"

### Query-to-Vector Translation
- Convert natural language to embedding space queries
- Generate multiple search vectors for complex queries
- Handle negation and exclusion criteria
- Support query refinement and iterative search

### Context Management
- Maintain conversation history and context
- Support follow-up questions and clarifications
- Handle ambiguous queries with clarification requests
- Preserve search session state

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core NLP Functionality
- [ ] Intent classification accuracy > 90% on test queries
- [ ] Entity extraction identifies relevant code elements
- [ ] Query expansion improves search recall
- [ ] Multi-turn conversation context preserved correctly
- [ ] Handles 20+ different query patterns accurately

### Query Processing Quality
- [ ] Natural language queries translate to effective searches
- [ ] Ambiguous queries trigger appropriate clarifications
- [ ] Query refinement improves results iteratively
- [ ] Context-aware responses maintain conversation flow
- [ ] Error messages are helpful and actionable

### Performance Standards
- [ ] Query processing completes in < 100ms
- [ ] Supports 50+ concurrent query sessions
- [ ] Memory usage per session < 10MB
- [ ] Response generation < 500ms end-to-end
- [ ] Session state persists across application restarts

## Implementation Notes

### NLP Pipeline Architecture
```python
# Example query processing pipeline
class NLQueryProcessor:
    def __init__(self, search_engine: SemanticSearchEngine):
        self.search_engine = search_engine
        self.intent_classifier = IntentClassifier()
        self.entity_extractor = EntityExtractor()
        self.query_expander = QueryExpander()
    
    def process_query(self, query: str, context: ConversationContext = None) -> QueryResponse:
        # Multi-stage query processing
        intent = self.intent_classifier.classify(query)
        entities = self.entity_extractor.extract(query)
        expanded_query = self.query_expander.expand(query, entities)
        
        search_results = self.search_engine.search(expanded_query, context)
        return self.format_response(search_results, intent, context)
    
    def handle_clarification(self, response: str, original_context: ConversationContext) -> QueryResponse:
        # Process clarification and refine search
        pass
```

### Intent Classification
```python
# Query intent categories
class QueryIntent(Enum):
    FIND_FUNCTION = "find_function"
    UNDERSTAND_FLOW = "understand_flow"
    COMPARE_IMPLEMENTATIONS = "compare_implementations"
    FIND_PATTERN = "find_pattern"
    LOCATE_BUG = "locate_bug"
    FIND_EXAMPLES = "find_examples"
    EXPLAIN_CODE = "explain_code"
```

### Query Expansion Strategies
- Synonym expansion using code-specific vocabularies
- Technology stack aware expansions
- Domain-specific term mapping
- Historical query pattern learning

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Intent classification accuracy across query types
- Entity extraction precision and recall
- Query expansion effectiveness
- Context management and session handling

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end query processing with search engine
- Multi-turn conversation flow validation
- Error handling and recovery scenarios
- Performance under concurrent usage

### User Experience Tests
- Natural language query usability testing
- Conversation flow and clarification effectiveness
- Response quality and helpfulness assessment
- Edge case handling (unclear, contradictory queries)

### Evaluation Datasets
- Curated test queries with expected intents
- Real developer query logs for validation
- Multi-language query support testing
- Cross-domain query handling assessment

## Success Metrics
- Intent classification: > 90% accuracy
- Query processing: < 100ms latency
- User satisfaction: > 4.2/5.0 rating
- Successful query resolution: > 80% first attempt
- Clarification success rate: > 95% after one round

## Integration Points
- Seamless integration with semantic search engine (task 011)
- Vector database query optimization (task 009)
- Relationship graph context utilization (task 010)
- Future chatbot and assistant integrations

## Future Enhancements
- Multi-modal queries (code + natural language)
- Voice query processing support
- Personalized query understanding
- Integration with code generation workflows
