## 3. Vector Index Type Comparison

### Flat Index (Brute Force)
**Algorithm**: Linear scan of all vectors

```sql
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE vecs USING vec0(embedding float[768]);
```

**Performance:**
- Search time: O(n) - Linear with dataset size
- Memory: Minimal overhead
- Accuracy: 100% (exact nearest neighbors)

**Benchmarks (10k vectors, 768 dims):**
- Query time: ~5-10ms
- Index size: ~30MB
- Build time: <1 second

**Best for:**
- ✅ Datasets < 100k vectors
- ✅ When accuracy is critical
- ✅ Simple use cases
- ❌ Not scalable beyond 100k

---

### IVF Index (Inverted File Index)
**Algorithm**: Cluster vectors, search relevant clusters

```sql
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE vecs USING vec0(
    embedding float[768],
    +ivf(100)  -- 100 clusters
);
```

**Performance:**
- Search time: O(√n) approximately
- Memory: Moderate overhead (cluster centroids)
- Accuracy: 95-99% (approximate)

**Benchmarks (100k vectors, 768 dims):**
- Query time: ~15-25ms
- Index size: ~350MB
- Build time: 2-5 minutes

**Configuration:**
```python
# Tune for accuracy vs speed
n_lists = int(math.sqrt(n_vectors))  # Rule of thumb
n_probe = n_lists // 10  # Search 10% of clusters
```

**Best for:**
- ✅ Datasets 100k - 1M vectors
- ✅ Good balance of speed/accuracy
- ✅ Tunable performance
- ❌ Slower index building

---

### HNSW Index (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)
**Algorithm**: Graph-based approximate search

```sql
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE vecs USING vec0(
    embedding float[768],
    +hnsw(M=16, ef_construction=200)
);
```

**Performance:**
- Search time: O(log n)
- Memory: High overhead (graph structure)
- Accuracy: 95-99% (approximate)

**Benchmarks (1M vectors, 768 dims):**
- Query time: ~1-5ms
- Index size: ~5GB
- Build time: 15-30 minutes

**Configuration:**
```python
# M: number of connections per node (16-64)
# ef_construction: accuracy during build (100-500)
# ef_search: accuracy during search (50-500)
```

**Best for:**

## Recommended Approach for Snipr

Based on your codebase analysis, I recommend:

### 🎯 **Optimal Configuration:**

1. **Installation**: **Python Package**
   - Rationale: You're using `uv` and have clean dependency management
   - Easy integration with existing workflow
   - Quick to prototype and test

2. **Migration**: **Dual System with Feature Flag**
   - Rationale: Production-ready approach with safety
   - Can test with real workloads
   - Gradual rollout possible
   - Code structure supports it (Config class)

3. **Index Type**: **Start with Flat, prepare for IVF**
   - Rationale: Your current scale likely < 100k chunks

   - Plan IVF migration path for growth

4. **Dimensions**: **Keep 768 initially, consider 384 later**
   - Rationale: Maintain compatibility first
   - Benchmark with real data
   - Optimize if needed after proven success
